<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Muneeb Mennad, a passionate second-year computer science student with a love for problem-solving and technology. Welcome to my virtual space!
</p>
<p>
  Ever since I laid my hands on a computer, I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities that coding and programming offer. From creating intricate algorithms to developing innovative software solutions, I'm constantly amazed by the power of technology to shape our world.
</p>
<p>
  Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, I'm dedicated to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming languages, data structures, and software development methodologies.
